Practice Quiz: While Loops
TOTAL POINTS 4

1.Question 1
What are while loops in Python?


While loops let the computer execute a set of instructions while a condition is true.


While loops instruct the computer to execute a piece of code a set number of times.


While loops let us branch execution on whether or not a condition is true.


While loops are how we initialize variables in Python.

2.Question 2
Fill in the blanks to make the print_prime_factors function print all the prime factors of a number. A prime factor is a number that is prime and divides another without a remainder.

def print_prime_factors(number):
  # Start with two, which is the first prime
  factor = ___
  # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
  while factor <= number:
    # Check if factor is a divisor of number
    if number % factor == ___:
      # If it is, print it and divide the original number
      print(factor)
      number = number / factor
    else:
      # If it's not, increment the factor by one
      ___
  return "Done"
print_prime_factors(100) # Should print 2,2,5,5

3.Question 3
The following code can lead to an infinite loop. Fix the code so that it can finish successfully for all numbers.


def is_power_of_two(n):
  # Check if the number can be divided by two without a remainder
  while n % 2 == 0:
    n = n / 2
  # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two
  if n == 1:
    return True
return False

4.Question 4
Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder.

def sum_divisors(n):
  # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
  return 0
print(sum_divisors(6)) # Should be 1+2+3=6
print(sum_divisors(12)) # Should be 1+2+3+4+6=16
